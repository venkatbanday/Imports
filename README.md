# Imports

**Imports**

There is a volume of 1,500 to 2,000 containers being imported from West Africa, specifically for shea nuts destined for India. Ocean freight rates have been finalized from the loading port to Chennai.

**Steps Taken:**

1. Requested quotes from all shipping lines that operate from West Africa to India, prioritizing the nearest ports to manufacturing units rather than solely focusing on Chennai.
   
2. Negotiated for 21 to 30 free days from the shipping lines due to the larger volumes and the accumulation of containers en route, resulting in a significant number of containers arriving at the destination.

3. Re-negotiated rates and created competition among the shipping lines to achieve greater benefits. There is currently low demand for liners operating from West Africa to India, which puts pressure on them to avoid moving containers empty, as that would be more costly than transporting a loaded cargo.

4. Based on the quotes from the shipping lines, started negotiating with container freight stations to secure the lowest package cost per container, ensuring that the free days offered by the liners are matched and requesting additional free warehouse days due to the larger volumes.

5. Container freight stations rely on larger imports to boost exports, as both are interdependent. Failing to achieve this forces them to obtain empty containers from other ports, incurring additional costs.

6. Dispatched materials to manufacturing units based on daily requirements, eliminating the need to store materials in a warehouse and thereby avoiding extra costs.

As a result of these strategies, costs have been significantly reduced, playing a crucial role in maintaining healthy profit margins in this business.
